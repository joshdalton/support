# Users
> Paramify allows you to add additional users, and offers several user types for differing use cases 
## Overview
Paramify was intentionally designed to involve as many individuals within your organization as possible in your security program, embracing the concept of "many hands make a burden light." This approach recognizes that GRC professionals often have a broad understanding of security across the company but may not be experts in every aspect or the specifics of implementation. Therefore, it's highly beneficial to engage domain experts and delegate specific portions of security content to them. This shared approach fosters widespread adoption throughout the organization.

## Add Users

### Collaborator
Collaborators are typically include external members who possess valuable insights to the implementation and status of Risk solutions. They can view and edit Risk Solutions assigned to them, and they can also create and edit Elements.
