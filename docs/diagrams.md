## Front Matter
To add front matter to your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project you're working on.
2. In the project side navigation, select "Project Overview."
3. Click on either the "Start" or "Review" button.
4. A section can fall into one of three categories:
    - **Narrative:** A section designed for writing narratives.
    - **Element Table:** A section for selecting a set of elements.
    - **Diagram:** A section for attaching diagrams.

We will provide detailed information on each of these section types below.

### Narratives
Narrative sections are meant for text. The text editor supports a subset of HTML elements and styles, and the output will adhere to the document template produced by our document automation tool. The following HTML elements are supported:
- Headings `<h1>` through `<h3>`
- Bold text `<strong>`
- Italics `<em>`
- Inline code `<code>`
- Lists `<ul>` and `<ol>` (unordered and ordered)
- Links `<a>`
- Tables `<table>`

### Element Tables
Certain sections provide options for selecting sets of elements, such as "Users," "Interconnections," or "Ports, Protocols, and Services." Depending on the section, these tables may function in one of two modes: Automatic or Manual.

**Automatic Mode:** Elements are automatically selected based on their presence within the project, including any Risk Solutions used in the project.

**Manual Mode:** If you require more control over the items in the table, you can switch to manual mode. This allows you to manually select the elements to include in the table, drawing from the available options in your Element Library.

### Diagrams
Some project overview sections may require diagrams, such as Architecture, Data Flow, or Network Diagrams. If a section allows diagrams, you will find a designated area for "Attached Diagrams." To add a diagram, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Add a new diagram" button.
2. Upload an image and optionally provide a caption and summary.
3. You can add as many diagrams as necessary.
