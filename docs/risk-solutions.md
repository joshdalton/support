## Overview
Risk Solutions are a crucial part of your security strategy. They represent capabilities that your organization either currently possesses, plans to implement, or does not yet have. Importantly, these Risk Solutions are framework-agnostic, meaning they can be applied to satisfy controls from any framework. 

Paramify maintains a library of battle-tested Risk Solutions, audited and certified many times over. Depending on your license, you are welcome to use any Risk Solutions as-is, customize it to your needs, or write your own.

## Creating a Risk Solution
To create a Risk Solution, navigate to the appropriate page and click on the "Add Solution" button. Assign a name to the solution and optionally categorize it for easier searching and filtering. After saving, you can add additional information.

* **Narrative**: A brief statement explaining the capability. It should mention elements from your library. It can also use dynamic template tags to automatically populate information unique to a project. Each narrative is associated with a specific responsible role, or the person tasked with making the narrative "true".
* **Implementation Status**: This field indicates whether the solution is currently in operation, planned for implementation, not implemented, or not applicable for some reason.
* **Main Component**: This field helps you associate components to a set of capabilities. If left blank, it is assumed that the capability is inherent to the overall system.

## Mapping Risk Solutions to Controls
Mapping Risk Solutions to control parts streamlines the management of requirement responses and reduces redundancy. To map a solution to a control, navigate to the solution detail page and click on the "Mappings" tab.

Risk Solutions can be mapped in three ways:
* **To a project requirement**: Risk Solutions can be mapped directly to specific requirements in a project.
* **To a source requirement**: Risk Solutions can be mapped generically to a source requirement, meaning it may or may not be applicable to a specific project.
* **To a component or collection**: Risk Solutions can be mapped to a component or collection of components, meaning that the solution is only applicable when that component is in scope.
