# Attachments
> Attachments reference your supporting documentation

## Overview
Most projects in Paramify have a required set of attachments that need to be included with the SSP. Paramify clearly indicates which appendices are auto-generated at the top of each section. For items we donâ€™t yet auto-generate, we provide template links for official templates.

Paramify provides a place for you to specify the **filenames** of each attachment.  This allows Document Robot to reference the attachments across documents, as needed.

## Adding Attachments
There are several types of attachments:
- **Required Attachments**: A required attachment may be required by the specific certification program. They are expected to be referenced in the SSP.
- **Other Attachments**: You may choose to attach other attachments in the SSP that may or may not be required. These will print as expected in the attachments sections of the documentation.
- **Attachments with Remarks**: You may choose to provide remarks for any given attachment. This can helpful, for example, if you have decided to omit a certain required attachment, and want to explain why you are not including it.
- **Generated Attachments**: Paramify will generate some attachments for you based on the information you provide in the SSP. These attachments will be contained the zip file produced by document robot. Currently, Paramify does not support renaming the generated outputs, but this will be supported soon. As with other attachments, you can still specify the filename and remarks to be printed in the SSP.

:::warning NOTE
Currently, Paramify does not allow you to upload these attachments to Paramify. If this is functionality would be important to you, please let us know at support@paramify.com.
