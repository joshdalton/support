# Generating an OSCAL Based SSP
Leverage the power of machine-readable compliance documentation with OSCAL.

## Overview
OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) is a standardized language for representing security controls and assessments. Paramify provides support for OSCAL SSPs (System Security Plans). This guide demonstrates the process of creating an OSCAL SSP within Paramify.

## Steps to Generate an OSCAL SSP
Every project within Paramify has its own OSCAL SSP. Here's how you can generate one:

1. Navigate to your desired project.
2. Proceed to the 'Document Robot' page.
3. To download the current OSCAL SSP, click on `Download OSCAL`.

If you want to include the OSCAL SSP as part of a zip file with all other project documents, you need to create a project revision:

1. Click on 'Add Revision'.
2. Define a version.
3. Provide a description.
4. Specify an Author (choose a party element from your library).
5. Set a date (default is the current date).
6. Click 'Save'.

Once the package is ready, you can download the zip file by clicking on the 'Download' button. This zip file will contain the OSCAL SSP along with all other project documents.
