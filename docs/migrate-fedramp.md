## Overview
One of the most powerful features of Paramify is to migrate your FedRAMP Rev4 projects to FedRAMP Rev5. 

:::tip
Rev5 controls do not map 1:1 to Rev4 controls. Therefore, it's imperative that you have mapped your Risk Solutions to both Rev4 and Rev5 controls. Paramify can help you do this as part of our short intake process.

## Migrating to Rev5
1. Navigate to the "All Projects" page.
2. Locate any FedRAMP Rev4 project and click on the "more" icon at the far left.
3. Click on "Migrate to Rev5"
4. In the popup window, choose from the options and press OK.
5. A new Rev5 project copy will be created.

Depending on the options you selected, you may need to go reapply parameter settings and apply suggested Risk Solutions.
